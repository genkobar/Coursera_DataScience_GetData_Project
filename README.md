### Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course Project

The file "run_analysis.R" contains all the steps necessary to turn the data from the "UCI HAR Dataset.zip" package into a tidy dataset with only mean and standard deviation values, and then into a smaller dataset with the average values of each column, grouped by subject number and activity type.

The script attempts to load the R-package named "dplyr" so please make sure it is installed.

The "UCI HAR Dataset.zip" package should be unzipped into the working directory before the script is run.

A decription of what the script does, as well as variable names, may be found in the file CookBook.md.
